    "## Introduction to Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear regression** is a class of techniques that relates one or a group of variables, known as **predictor/design/feature/regressor variables**, to a **response variable**. The predictors are independent variables whereas the response is a dependent variable. Such a relationship is known as a **model**. Given that a response variable is $Y$ and its predictor variable is $X$, the following constitutes a linear model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "Y = b_0 + b_1 X\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is just a simple line, where $b_0$ is the **intercept** and $b_1$ is the **slope**, but it demonstrates the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ in a simple manner. $X$ is proportional to $Y$ by $b_1$ and offset by $b_0$. Collectively, the $b_i$'s are known as the **parameters/coefficients/weights** of the model. However, data in real life has variability. It becomes necessary to add a Gaussian probability density distribution as an error term ($\\varepsilon$) to the end of the linear model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Y = b_0 + b_1 X + \\varepsilon\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The error term is assumed to have a mean of 0 and the same variance at every $X$. Below shows a graphical image of how the error term distributes the possible values of $Y$ given an $X$ value [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/images/linear regression with normal error distribution.png\" align=center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of linear regression given a set of ($X$, $Y$) data is to estimate what $b_0$ and $b_1$ is. We denote the estimated versions of $b_0$ and $b_1$ as $\\widehat{b}_0$ and $\\widehat{b}_1$. Using $X$ with the estimated values, we have an estimated version of $Y$ as well:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of $\\widehat{y}$ are simply the means of the distribution of the response given the observed values of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple linear regression** is a one-to-one relationship where one independent variable is matched to one response variable. **Multiple linear regression** describes a many-to-one relationship where a group of independent variables are matched to one response variable. Multiple linear regression expands $X$ to $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_n$ and $b_1$ to $b_1$, $b_2$, ..., $b_n$.\n",

    "## The Method of Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "This section involves generating an estimate for $b_0$ and $b_1$. The common technique is known as the **method of least squares**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate derivation of a least-squares problem involves linear algebra and maximum likelihood estimation and will not be covered here. Simply put, we want to minimize the difference between the true $y$'s and the estimated $\\widehat{y}$'s. Ideally, if $\\widehat{y} = y$ then $y - \\widehat{y} = 0$. However, due to the error term, this will not be the case. For every $X$ value, there will be some difference in $y - \\widehat{y}$, known as a **residual**. Sometimes $\\widehat{y}$ will be greater than $y$ and other times it will be less than $y$. The net error would be the addition of all of these residuals. To ensure that two residuals don't cancel each other out, we square each one before adding them together. The sum is known as the **sum of squared error**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "SSE = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - \\widehat{y}_i)^2 = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - (b_0 + b_1 x_i))^2 = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - b_0 - b_1 x_i)^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to try and find estimates for $b_0$ and $b_1$ that will minimize the value of the SSE. If we minimize the SSE, then we also minimize all of the residuals. To figure out which values of $b_0$ and $b_1$ will minimize the SSE, we take partial derivatives of the SSE equation with respect to each of the parameters respectively:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial (SSE)}{\\partial b_0} = \\frac{\\partial (\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - b_0 - b_1 x_i)^2)}{\\partial b_0} = -2 \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - b_0 - b_1 x_i)\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the minimum SSE based on both $b_0$ and $b_1$, we set each partial derivative to 0 and solve for each parameter:\n",

    "HEIGHT_i = 25.224 + 2.787 (AGE_i)\n",

    "This equation signifies that the average height per age is close to 3x that of the age value offset by 25.\n",

    "The sum of squared error in our model amounts to $SSE = 161.621$. This represents the total squared deviation of our data from our predicted means. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the \"Fit Plot for Height\" graph. The original data is shown as age vs. height scatter points. The \"Fit\" line is the line through the mean of each height distribution given a certain age value. Since we are dealing with probability distributions, it becomes important to demonstrate where the true mean, given an infinite amount of data, could potentially lie through the use of 95% confidence intervals. The prediction intervals indicate our confidence in where a future height value for an unmeasured age (like age 10) could lie. With this example, however, we do know that the confidence and prediction intervals are only valid for a certain range of ages. People stop growing as they get older, so we expect (given more data) for the CIs and the PIs to level off after a certain age.\n",

    "If $H_0$ holds true for either parameter, this means that the feature variable associated with that parameter is being multiplied by 0. Thus, that particular feature variable has no effect on the value of the response variable and is effectively taken out of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the null hypothesis, SAS uses the t-statistic and finds its p-value. t-statistic expressions can be found from the equations for each parameter in section 4. Usually, p-values are compared against $\\alpha = 0.05$. If the p-value is above $0.05$, then the null hypothesis ($H_0$) cannot be rejected. If the p-value is below $0.05$, then the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is rejected for the alternate hypothesis ($H_1$).\n",

    "The p-values for $\\widehat{b}_0$ and $\\widehat{b}_1$ can be found under the \"Pr > |t|\" heading in the \"Parameter Estimates\" table. Given the small values for each parameter, it can be concluded that neither the intercept or the AGE variable can be taken out of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a check using the analysis of variance method, we see that the model's f-value is $32.77$ with a small p-value in the \"Analysis of Variance\" table, indicating that much of the variance found in the original data can be explained by the model. This lends credence to our model being a good fit to the data.\n",
