    "## Validation/Cross-validation of Model\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first steps to take when diagnosing a model for overfitting is to look at the degrees of freedom. For a feature variable set, $df = n - k - 1$, where $k$ is the number of $b_i$'s (not including $b_0$) there are. Imagine each degree of freedom as how much \"wiggle room\" a model has to adapt to new response values. As $k$ increases, the $df$ will decrease, signifying a reduction of this \"wiggle room.\" Therefore, as the amount of $k$ increases, your model will become less and less flexible to new results. If $k$ approaches $n$, then the danger of overfitting increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common technique to check for underfitting/overfitting is to split your data into two different datasets: a **training set** and a **cross-validation set**. The training set contains the data you use to build the model. The cross-validation set is the data you use once you've estimated $\\widehat{b}_i$ from the training set to see whether your model returns comparable results. The cross-validation set can be thought of as \"new\" data that the model has not seen. A typical training set consists of $2/3$ of the data, with the cross-validation set representing the other $1/3$. Let's modify our definition of $SSE$, where $SSE = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\left(y_i - \\mathbf{\\vec{x}_i} \\mathbf{\\vec{b}} \\right)^2$, a bit to get the **cost function**:\n",

The cost function defined is essentially just the mean squared error. Since datasets from similar sources will produce smaller $SSE$ if their number of observations is smaller, the $MSE$ helps normalize this difference by looking at the average squared deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the training set and cross-validation set in place, we can compare the $MSE$s for a variety of different models to see which one has a happy balance between bias and variance.\n",

We start at $b_1 x$ and find the $MSE$ of both the training and cross-validation sets and add those values to our plot. Then we add an $b_ 2 x^2$ term to the model and find the $MSE$s of the two datasets again. We repeat the process for $b_3 x^3$ and so on. As a result, we will have two curves, one representing the cost of increasing polynomial order for the training data, and another for the cross-validation data. To diagnose the model:\n",

    "**Regularization** is a class of techniques to help reduce the amount of overfitting model estimates can produce by shrinking the size of the model estimates. This can create a model in which all terms contribute to the estimation of the response variable or simply remove specific feature variables from the model. It incurs a penality to the model based on the amount of feature variables the model contains. The most common type of regularization is ridge regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization.\n",

Depending on the value for $t$, some of the coefficients will shrink to $0$, effectively eliminating its corresponding feature variable from the model. Thus, LASSO combines both regularization and feature selection methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Least angle regression** (LAR) is a type of forward selection algorithm that takes into account the correlation of both the response variable and the feature variable. All coefficients are first set to $0$. The coefficient of the feature variable most correlated with the response is increased in the direction of the correlation until another feature variable becomes correlated with the resulting residuals. Then the original coefficient and the coefficient of this second feature variable are then increased based on the joint least squares direction until a third feature variable becomes correlated with the resulting residuals. This repeats until all of the feature variables are included or the stop criteria is met. This method produces similar solutions to LASSO.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elastic Net** combines both LASSO and ridge regression, where coefficients have to satisfy both constraints. This is useful for the following cases:\n",
    "* there are more feature variables than observations ($k > n$)\n",
    "* there are high correlations between different feature variables\n",
